== WARNING! THIS IS AN MODIFIED VERSION OF SEABIOS ==

  Changed keyboard layout to NEO2 Layout to have NEO2 Layout in DOS
  (http://www.neo-layout.org)

  Still experimental, only support for Layers 1-3. Layer 4 might follow
  Layers 5-8 most likely don't make sense due to lack of UTF-8 support
  in DOS ;-)

== ORIGINAL README FOLLOWS ==

Welcome to the SeaBIOS project!  This project implements an X86 legacy
bios that is built with standard GNU tools.

Please see build and developer information at:

  http://seabios.org/Developer_Documentation

For the impatient, SeaBIOS is built for QEMU and tested on QEMU with:

  make
  qemu -bios out/bios.bin

SeaBIOS can be configured with kconfig.  To change the default
configuration one can run "make menuconfig" prior to running "make".

For other types of builds, and for more detailed developer
documentation, please see the online documentation listed above.
